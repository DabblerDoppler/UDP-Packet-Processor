# UDP Packet Processor

A high-performance UDP header parser using a 256-bit AXI input stream. Designed with low latency for High-Frequency Trading (HFT) applications.

## Features

- 256-bit AXI-style stream interface
- Low-latency packet processing
- Configurable packet filtering
- Backpressure functionality
- Optimized for Arria 10 implementation

## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](docs/architecture.png)

The UDP Packet Processor consists of the following key components:
- Header Parser
- Payload Extractor
- Checksum Verification
- Packet Filter
- Output Buffer

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Maximum Clock Frequency | X MHz |
| Latency (min) | X clock cycles |
| Latency (max) | X clock cycles |
| Resource Utilization | X LUTs, X FFs, X BRAMs |
| Throughput | X Gbps |

## Simulation and Verification

The design has been verified using:
- Unit tests for individual modules
- Integration tests for the complete system
- Randomized test vectors
- Directed test cases for edge conditions

## Implementation Results

The design has been synthesized for Arria 10 with the following results:
- [Include timing, area, and power results]
